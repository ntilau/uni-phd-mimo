	antennas and half-slot antennas are proposed in this letter. Each
	of the antennas constitutes three mutually perpendicular radiating
	elements to achieve good isolation and low antenna signal correlation
	between ports. The antennas are fabricated on FR4 epoxy boards and
	experimental results are provided. Experimental results show that
	the antennas resonate at 2.55 GHz and have a mutual coupling of less
	than -18 dB between elements. In addition, experimental results for
	the diversity performance and the multiple-input-multiple-output
	(MIMO) channel capacity are also provided for these antennas and
	these show that the proposed antennas offer good diversity gain and
	the channel capacity can be increased by as much as three times by
	using these antennas.},

  abstract = { The use of multiple antennas has found various applications in the
	area of wireless communications. One such application has recently
	become very popular and is referred to as the multiple-input multiple-output
	(MIMO) antenna system. The main idea behind MIMO is to establish
	independent parallel channels between multiple transmit and receive
	antennas. Each channel uses the same frequency, and the transmissions
	occur simultaneously. In such a configuration, the amount of data
	transmitted increases linearly with the number of parallel channels,
	which is what makes MIMO so popular in the wireless world. The enormous
	capacity offered by MIMO systems is not realizable when the parallel
	channels are highly correlated. The goal of this article is to highlight
	the correlation concept and its impact on MIMO systems. Although
	correlation can be defined in many dimensions, here we focus on spatial
	correlation, and specifically consider antenna correlations in mobile
	units. We provide an overview of spatial correlation and present
	its underlying parameters in detail. Special attention is given to
	mutual coupling since it has signal decorrelation and antenna gain
	reduction effects. We then present how correlation in a MIMO system
	affects the amount of data that can be transmitted (MIMO capacity)
	and briefly review how power should be distributed with the knowledge
	of correlation. Analyses indicate that in real propagation environments,
	the high capacity gain of MIMO systems can be realized with improved
	antenna selection algorithms and power allocation strategies.},
